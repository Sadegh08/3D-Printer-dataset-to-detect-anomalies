# 3D-Printer-dataset-to-detect-anomalies


Deep Learning Project:
My initial deep learning attempt can be found in this repository, created by using a Kaggle dataset and trained in Google Colab. 
The project contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and testing, as well as a README file (README.md) to provide an overview of the project. 
The data is also used for building the 3D printer anomaly detection system.https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justin900429/3d-printer-defected-dataset
This dataset includes two different kinds of data: Defected & Non-defected.
